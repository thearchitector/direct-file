1. initial

this is the open source IRS DirectFile application. this application has since been shut down, and our objective is to rebuild a new open source web-app-based tax assistance software that enables people to fill out their 1040 / basic generally applicable required forms for federal filing.

analyze this entire product, starting with @ONBOARDING.md . document everything you learn about the design, architecture, and structure of DirectFile in a series of new markdown documents in @ai*research . your objective is to produce coherent and organized documentation that can then inform the design of a new web application (preferably with a python backend, though this should not be super important for your current task). the most important part of this task is grasping the most complete picture possible as to \_why* certain design decisions were made for this software, and how those decisions fit into the purpose of tax fiiling assistance.

do not leave any stone unturned, or leave anything undocumented because you think it is inferred or obvious. assume the person or agent reading the documentation later has 0 knowledge of the tax code. the more research research and analysis the better. be thorough, and make sure to organize your research findings into documents that make sense. use nested directory structures when appropriate to indicate groups of topics, areas of research, etc. this documentation will be referened primarily by you (an ai agent) in the future, though it should still be generally navigable and digestible by me (human).

do not stop until you are done. do not ask me any questions about whether to proceed or not. always keep going.
